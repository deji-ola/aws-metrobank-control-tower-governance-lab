## Control Tower status (post-decommission)

- Control Tower console in us-east-1 shows a banner confirming the previous landing zone has been decommissioned.
- The main page presents an “Enable AWS Control Tower” option, meaning no active landing zone exists.
- AWS documentation notes that manual cleanup of certain resources (log buckets, CloudTrail log groups, OUs) is required after decommissioning and before re-enabling the landing zone.
